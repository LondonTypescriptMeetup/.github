# London Typescript Meetup

This is the repository for the London Typescript Meetup group. We use this repository to organise our events and to share resources.

## Events

We usually run events every quarter. We have a [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/London-Typescript-Meetup/) where you can find out about upcoming events and RSVP.

## Sponsors
Thank you to this quarter's sponsor - [PrimaryBid](https://primarybid.com/) - Public markets were created to allow everyone to invest in and own companies they believe in. But the public has been missing out on valuable share offers for decades. Until recently, only institutional investors could access IPOs and follow-ons. PrimaryBid is changing that. Weâ€™ve created the technology to make sure public markets are inclusive, transparent and fair, as they were always meant to be.
[Check out their careers page](https://primarybid.com/careers/).


We are always looking for sponsors to help us run our events. If you are interested in sponsoring us, please get in touch with us by raising an issue [here](https://github.com/LondonTypescriptMeetup/sponsors/issues/new).
